# Chapter 1. Notes - The Role of Algorithms in Computing

---

### 1.1 Algorithms
_algorithm_
- computational procedure where input -> algorithm -> output

_instance_
- unique input sequence
Ex. {1, 4, 2} is one instance, {4, 6, 8} is another 

_data structure_
- way to store and organize data
- differs across programming languages
Ex. linked lists, stacks, queues

_NP-complete_
- problems with no known best efficient solution
- not yet proven that solution exists/cannot exist
- if solution to one exists, solution to all exists

_shortest path problem_
- find shortest path available

_travelling salesman problem_
- shortest path problem but w/ multiple destinations and must return to origin

### 1.2 Algorithms as a technology

- algorithm efficiency is based on memory usage & computing time
