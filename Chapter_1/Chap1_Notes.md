For CLRS 2nd Ed. (2001)

### 1.1   Algorithms
algorithm
- computational procedure where input -> algorithm -> output

instance
- unique input sequence

data structure
- way to store and organize data
- differs across programming languages

NP-complete
- problems with no known best efficient solution
- not yet proven that solution exists/cannot exist
- if solution to one exists, solution to all exists

travelling salesman problem
- shortest-path problem but w/ multiple destinations and must return to origin
