### 1.1   Algorithms
**1.1-1**
sorting - inventory checks

**1.1-2**
memory usage, simplicity of implementation

**1.1-3**
array
pros:
- can access any element at any time
- can be in more than one dimension
cons:
- fixed size
- relatively high memory usage

**1.1-4**
similarity: both find shortest path
difference: 
- shortest-path ends at destination,
- travelling-salesman has multiple destinations & ends at origin

**1.1-5**
best - finding dimensions in architecture
approximate - solutions to differential equations
